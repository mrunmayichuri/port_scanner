# port_scanner

The scanning is done by sending packets with SYN flag set to each port and listening for the replies.

The backtrack machine sends a SYN packet as if to initiate 3-way handshake, if the external router responds with a SYN/ACK packet from a particular port, it means the port is OPEN.
If the external router responds with RST packet, it means port is CLOSED.
However, if backtrack machine doesnâ€™t receive any packet, the packet may have lost in the transmission or port has been FILTERED.
